Formatted questions:

Question 1
Problem Statement
Write a function that accepts a string of length n that may contain the character ‘#’. Move all the ‘#’ characters to the front of the string and return the resulting string.

Function signature (C-style)
char* moveHash(char str[], int n);

Example
Input:
Move#Hash#to#Front
Output:
###MoveHashtoFront

---

Question 2
Problem Statement
Given a string where characters may be repeated consecutively, compress the string by replacing consecutive runs with the character followed by the run length (omit the count when it is 1).

Examples
Input: aabbbbeeeeffggg
Output: a2b4e4f2g3

Input: abbccccc
Output: ab2c5

Question 3
Problem Statement
Traverse a matrix in spiral order and print the elements in that order.

Sample Input
5 4
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20

Sample Output (spiral order)
1 2 3 4 8 12 16 20 19 18 17 13 9 5 6 7 11 15 12 14 10

(Note: preserve the exact expected output ordering as required by your test cases.)

---

Question 4
Problem Statement
Given a list of integers, count the occurrences of each distinct value and print the counts.

Sample Input
10
1 2 3 3 4 1 4 5 1 2

Sample Output
1 occurs 3 times
2 occurs 2 times
3 occurs 2 times
4 occurs 2 times
5 occurs 1 time

---

Question 5
Problem Statement
Evaluate the expression a^3 + a^2 b + 2 a^2 b + 2 a b^2 + a b^2 + b^3. Write a program that accepts values for a, b (and c if required by your interface) and outputs the result of the expression.

(Clarify whether c is needed; the expression uses only a and b.)

---

Question 6
Problem Statement
Given the number of dealerships and for each dealership the counts of cars and bikes, compute the total number of tyres for each dealership (assume each car has 4 tyres and each bike has 2 tyres).

Sample Input
3
4 2
4 0
1 2

Sample Output
20
16
8

Explanation
Dealership 1: (4 cars × 4) + (2 bikes × 2) = 20
Dealership 2: (4 × 4) + (0 × 2) = 16
Dealership 3: (1 × 4) + (2 × 2) = 8

If you want, I can produce cleaned-up starter code for any of these problems (C/C++/Python).


Question 7
Problem Statement
Using Java's ArrayList, remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving the original order of first occurrences. 
Print the resulting list.

Sample Input
7
4 2 4 5 2 3 5

Sample Output
4 2 5 3

---

Question 8
Problem Statement
Given an ArrayList of integers and an integer k, rotate the list to the right by k 
positions (elements shifted off the end reappear at the front). Print the rotated list.

Sample Input
6 2
1 2 3 4 5 6

Sample Output
5 6 1 2 3 4

(Interpret k >= 0; if k >= n, rotate by k % n.)

---

Question 9
Problem Statement
Given two sorted ArrayLists of integers, merge them into a single sorted ArrayList (maintain non-decreasing order). Print the merged list.

Sample Input
3 4
1 3 5
2 3 6 7

Sample Output
1 2 3 3 5 6 7
