Question 1
Given an inteeger array of size n, task is to rotate the array, elements to the right by d positions.

Question 2
givven an array of integers and a index position d, rotate the array one elements from dth position to the end


Question 3
in a party of N people each person is denoted by an integer, couples are presented by the same number. find out the only single person at the party of couple

test case

1 2 3 2 1 output 3


Question 4
You have to write a function that will accept a string which length is "len", the string has some "#", in it. You
have to move all the hashes to the front of the string and return the whole string back and print it
TEST CASE:
> move#hash#to#the#front
output: ####movehashtothefront

Question 5
There are n houses built in a line, each of which contains some money. A robber wants
to steal money from the houses but he cant steal from two consecutive/adjacent houses.
the task is to find the maximum amount of money which can be stolen

test case:
A 100 B 200 C 300 D 400 E 500 F 600


Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, the task is to find weather there is a pair of elements 
in the array whhose sum is equal to the target.

arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1]

write a python code to rotate a matrix by 90 degree

question 7
Consider a string , S , that is a series of character, each followed by its frequency as an integer
the string is not compresed correctly, so there may be multiple occurances of the same character. A propery
of ea compressed string will consist of one instanc ch character in alphabetical order followed by total count 
of that character withing the string 

Question 8
Given a singly linked list, write a function to reverse the linked list. The function should take the head of the linked list as input and return the new head of the reversed linked list.

Example:
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL


Question 9

the function  def product smallestpair(sun arr) accepts an integer array of set n implement
the function to fin the pair(arr[i] arr[k]) where i = k, such that arr[i] and arr[k]
are the least two elements of the array(arr[i]+ arr[k]) <= sum and return the product element of the 
pair. Note return -1 if array is empty or if n<2 return 0 if no such pair found.

question 10

implement robin-karp algorithim


N base notion is a system for writing numbers which uses only n different symbols.
these symbols are the first n symbols from the given notation list (including the symbol for o) 
decimal to n based notation are (0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:7, 8:8, 9:9,
10:A, 11:B, and so on upto 35:Z) 

implement the following function char* DectoNBase(int n , int num):
the funtion accept a positive int n and num implement the function to calculate the n base equivalent of 
num and return the same as a string


the steps are 
devide the decimal no. by N treat the division as integer division
write the remainder in n based notation. 
divide the quotient again by n.
repeat step 2 and 3 untill the quotient is 0. 

Question 12. 

Write a python code to arrange the elements of an array based on the rand( frequency of their appearence.)
