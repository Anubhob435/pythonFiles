## Question 2

Maximum size square sub-matrix with all 1s
Given a binary matrix, find out the maximum size square sub-matrix with all 1s.

For eg â€“  if the entered matrix is
[{1,0,0,1,0},  {1,1,1,1,1},{1,0,1,1,1}, {0,0,1,1,0} , {1,1,1,1,1}], then the output will be
[{1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}]


## Question 2

Find Maximum Sum Submatrix in a given matrix
Given a M x N matrix, calculate maximum sum submatrix of size k x k in a given M x N matrix in O(M*N) time. Here, 0 < k < M, N.

For example, consider below 5 x 5 matrix

[ 3 -4 6 -5 1 ]
[ 1 -2 8 -4 -2 ]
[ 3 -8 9 3 1 ]
[ -7 3 4 2 7 ]
[ -3 7 -5 7 -6 ]

If k = 2, maximum sum k x k sub-matrix is

[ 9 3 ]
[ 4 2 ]

If k = 3, maximum sum k x k sub-matrix is

[ 8 -4 -2 ]
[ 9 3 1 ]
[ 4 2 7 ]


## Question 3

Given an n x n square matrix, find sum of all sub-squares of size k x k where k is smaller than or equal to n.

How to solve this problem
A Simple Solution is to one by one pick starting point (leftmost-topmost corner) of all possible sub-squares. Once the starting point is picked, calculate sum of sub-square starting with the picked starting point.

Examples :

Sample Input 1:
n = 5, k = 3
arr[][] = { {1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
{2, 2, 2, 2, 2},
{3, 3, 3, 3, 3},
{4, 4, 4, 4, 4},
{5, 5, 5, 5, 5},
};
Sample Output 1:
18 18 18
27 27 27
36 36 36
 

Sample Input 2:
n = 3, k = 2
arr[][] = { {1, 2, 3},
{4, 5, 6},
{7, 8, 9},
};
Sample Output 2:
12 16
24 28
