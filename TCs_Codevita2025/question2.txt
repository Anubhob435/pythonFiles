TwoScouts
Problem Description

Two elite scouts, Arin and Bran, are stationed in different towns. Their mission: each must deliver an encrypted message to the main outpost.

In the distant land of Graphonia, towns are connected by a network of roads. Communication between these towns is crucial for survival. The main outpost has become the hub for vital resources and intelligence.

Due to the sensitive nature of their information, the scouts must take separate routes to the outpost. They can only meet at the outpost—nowhere else. Each scout must travel along a path where:

Each scout ensures that no town is visited more than once throughout their assignment.
The two scouts' paths do not overlap at any town except the outpost.
The High Council wants to minimize the total number of towns visited by both scouts to ensure efficiency and reduce risk.

Your task: As the Royal Programmer, determine the minimum total number of towns visited by both scouts. If it is impossible for both scouts to reach the outpost under these constraints, report "Impossible".

Constraints
3 <= N <= 15

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers:

N — the number of towns

M — the number of roads connecting them

The next M lines each contain two space-separated integers, a and b, indicating that town a and town b are connected by a road.

The following line contains two space-separated integers: the starting towns of the two scouts.

The last line contains the integer representing the outpost town.

Output

Output a single integer: the minimum number of towns visited by both scouts, or "Impossible" if such paths do not exist.

Explanation

From the first line it is seen that there are 14 towns and 16 roads connecting them.

Arin is in town 1 and Bran is in town 12 and the outpost at 7.

Let us take paths taken by scouts as

Path taken by Arin: 1 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 7

Path taken by Bran: 12 -> 11 -> 13 -> 14 -> 7

The towns visited are: 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (8 towns in total). Hence 8 is the output.

Explanation

The scouts start at towns 1 and 2, with the outpost at town 5.

Let us take paths taken by scouts as

Arin's path: 1 -> 8 -> 6 -> 5

Bran's path: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 5
The total number of unique towns visited is 7.
