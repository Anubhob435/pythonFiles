## SQL BEGINNER 

# What is SQL?
    - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.
    - It provides a standardized way to interact witrh databases, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data.
    - SQL is used in various applications, from small-scale projects to large enterprise systems.

#Understanding Database and tables.
    - A table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns within a database.
    - A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed by a database management system (DBMS).

# DQL, DDl, DML 
    - DQL (Data Query Language): Used to query and retrieve data from a database. The primary command is `SELECT`.
    - DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to define and manage database structures, such as creating, altering, and dropping tables. Common commands include `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.
    - DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to manipulate data within the database, including inserting, updating, and deleting records. Common commands include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

# Filtering and Sorting Data
    - Filtering data involves using the `WHERE` clause to specify conditions that rows must meet to be included in the result set.
    - Sorting data can be done using the `ORDER BY` clause, which allows you to arrange the results in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.

# Grouping and Aggregating Data
    - Grouping data is done using the `GROUP BY` clause, which allows you to aggregate data based on one or more columns.
    - Aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` are used to perform calculations on grouped data.

# Join and Subqueries
    - Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Common types of joins include `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
    - Subqueries are nested queries that can be used within another SQL statement, allowing for more complex data retrieval and manipulation.

# Window functions
    - Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, allowing for advanced analytics without collapsing the result set.
    - Common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and aggregate functions used with the `OVER()` clause.

# Optimizing SQL Queries
    - Query optimization involves improving the performance of SQL queries by analyzing execution plans, indexing strategies, and query structure.
    - Techniques include using appropriate indexes, avoiding unnecessary joins, and minimizing the use of subqueries when possible.

# Indexing and Performance Tuning
    - Indexing is a technique used to speed up data retrieval by creating a data structure that allows for faster searches.
    - Performance tuning involves analyzing query performance, identifying bottlenecks, and making adjustments to improve efficiency.

# Automation and Scripting
    - Automation in SQL can be achieved through stored procedures, triggers, and scheduled jobs.
    - Scripting allows for the execution of multiple SQL statements in a single script, enabling batch processing and automation of repetitive tasks.

# Backup and Recovery
    - Backup and recovery are essential for data protection and disaster recovery in SQL databases.
    - Regular backups ensure that data can be restored in case of loss or corruption, while recovery processes allow for the restoration of the database to a previous state.
