# What is Artificial Intelligence?
    - The theory and development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, 
      speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation between languages.

# Machine Learning
    - A subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task 
      through experience.
# Deep Learning
    - A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various factors of

# NLP
    - Natural Language Processing, a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.

# Computer Vision
    - A field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world,
      such as images and videos.

# Knowledge based
    - A system that uses a knowledge base to solve complex problems by reasoning about the knowledge it contains.

# Expert Systems
    - AI systems that use a knowledge base and inference rules to solve specific problems, often in specialized domains.


# Artificial Intellegence vs Artificial General Intelligence vs Artificial Super Intelligence
    - Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
    - Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a type of AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.
    - Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) refers to a hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects, including creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence.

# TensorFlow 
    - An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, widely used for building and training deep learning models.

# Theano
    - A Python library for defining, optimizing, and evaluating mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays, often used for deep learning.

# Keras
    - An open-source neural network library written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation with deep learning models. It can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK).

# NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
    - A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data, providing easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources.
