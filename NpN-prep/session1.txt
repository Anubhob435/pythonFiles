## RDBMS

#RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is a type of database management system that stores data in a structured format using rows and columns. RDBMS uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and managing the data.  
It supports SQL based on sets and relationships.

#Transactions in RDBMS are ACID compliant, meaning they ensure Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

#Constraints in RDBMS are rules that enforce data integrity and consistency.

#Transaction logs are used to record all changes made to the database, allowing for recovery in case of a failure.
when something goes wrong, we can use transaction logs to rollback the changes made to the database. they improve recovery.
For example, transactions happen throughout the day, and at the end of the day, we do backup. if anything goes wromg the next dayk, we can use  previous
night backup to do a #rollback.

#Security in RDBMS is implemented through user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify the data.

#Triggers in RDBMS are special procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table or view, such as insertions, updates, or deletions. They are used to enforce business rules or maintain data integrity.

## DATA WAREHOUSE

What is Data WearHouse?
A Data Warehouse is a centralized repository that stores large volumes of structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources.
business users preffer Data WearHouse over traditional databases because it is optimized for query and analysis, allowing for faster retrieval of data and better performance 
on complex queries.

what is information?
it is processed data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making. Information is derived from raw data through various processes such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating.

What  are the advantages of Data WearHouse?
1. Improved data quality and consistency: Data Warehouses integrate data from various sources, ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date.
2. Enhanced data analysis and reporting: Data Warehouses support complex queries and analytics, enabling users to gain insights and make informed decisions based on the data.
3. Historical data storage: Data Warehouses can store large volumes of historical data, allowing for trend analysis and long-term decision-making.
4. Scalability: Data Warehouses can handle large volumes of data and can be scaled up. 

From query to result
take data from various sources -> integrate data  from multiple sources -> standardize data & remove inconsistencies -> store data in format suitable for easy access

## Properties of Data WearHouse

A data wearhouse is a "subject-oriented", "integrated", "time-variant", and "non-volatile" collection of data that supports decision-making processes.

| Users                  | Clerks, database administrators            | Business analysts, decision makers        |
| Data Volume            | Smaller, current data                      | Large, historical data                    |
| Response Time          | Fast for transactions                      | Fast for complex queries                  |
| Example                | Banking transactions, order entry systems  | Sales trend analysis, forecasting         |


## DATA MART 

Data mart is a smaller version of a data wearhouse, less sources of data, used to satify only a certain department or business unit.
Data mart is like sub parts of Data wearhouse divides to give access to specific departments or business units.

#Difference between Data Warehouse and Data Mart:

| Feature                | Data Warehouse                              | Data Mart                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Scope                  | Organization-wide                           | Department or business unit specific      |
| Data Sources           | Multiple, enterprise-wide                   | Few, focused on specific area             |
| Size                   | Large (terabytes to petabytes)              | Smaller (gigabytes to terabytes)          |
| Complexity             | High, integrates data from many sources     | Lower, simpler structure                  |
| Implementation Time    | Longer                                      | Shorter                                   |
| Users                  | Organization-wide decision makers           | Specific department users                 |
| Maintenance            | More complex                                | Easier                                    |
| Cost                   | Higher                                      | Lower                                     |

There are two approaches to Data Mart:
    top down approach: Data Mart is created from Data Warehouse, data is extracted from Data Warehouse and loaded into Data Mart.
    bottom up approach: Data Mart is created first, data is extracted from operational systems and loaded into Data Mart,
                        then Data Mart is integrated into Data Warehouse.

# Dependent data mart vs Independent data mart vs Hybrid data mart

> in dependent data mart, data is extracted from operational systems and loaded into Data wearhouser and then into data mart.
> in independent data mart, data is extracted from operational systems and loaded directly into data mart.
> in hybrid data mart, data is extracted from both operational systems and Data Warehouse and loaded into data mart.

## METADATA

    - Metadata is data about data. 
    - It provides information about the structure, content, and context of the data stored in a Data Warehouse or Data Mart.
    - Metadata is define where the data is coming from, how it is transformed, and how it is stored.
    - used to define what is source and what is target.

## DATA WEARHOUSE ARCHITECTURE

Database, Flat Files -> Staging Area (Staging Database) -> Data Warehouse(Meta Data, Aggregate Data, Raw Data) -> Data Marts(like Sales, Marketing, Finance) -> End Users (Business Analysts, Decision Makers)


## HANDS ON PRACTICE

# Oracle SQL Developer - Creating two tables  

# Talend Data integration - import the data from the oracle database and load it into the staging area, apply filter, create one accepted excel and the rejected ones into another excel.
