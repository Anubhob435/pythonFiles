## Recursion in Programming

**Definition**: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.

### Key Components of Recursion

1. **Base Case**: A condition that stops the recursion to prevent infinite loops
2. **Recursive Case**: The function calling itself with modified parameters
3. **Progress Toward Base Case**: Each recursive call should move closer to the base case

### How Recursion Works

When a function calls itself:
- Each call is added to the call stack
- Parameters and local variables are stored for each call
- Execution pauses until the recursive call returns
- Results are combined as calls return from the stack

### Common Recursive Patterns

- **Linear Recursion**: Single recursive call (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci)
- **Tree Recursion**: Multiple recursive calls (e.g., binary tree traversal)
- **Tail Recursion**: Recursive call is the last operation (optimizable)

### Advantages
- Cleaner, more readable code for naturally recursive problems
- Elegant solutions for tree/graph traversal
- Simplifies divide-and-conquer algorithms
- Natural fit for mathematical definitions

### Disadvantages
- Higher memory usage due to call stack
- Potential stack overflow for deep recursion
- Often slower than iterative solutions
- Can be harder to debug

### Best Practices
- Always define a clear base case
- Ensure progress toward the base case
- Consider iterative alternatives for simple problems
- Use memoization to optimize overlapping subproblems
- Be mindful of stack depth limitations

### Common Use Cases
- Tree and graph traversal
- Mathematical computations (factorial, Fibonacci)
- Divide-and-conquer algorithms (merge sort, quick sort)
- Backtracking problems (N-Queens, maze solving)
- Parser implementations
