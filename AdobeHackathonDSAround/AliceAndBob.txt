Alice and Bob's Sequence Alignment Problem
Problem Statement:
In the fantastic Land of Swaps, there are two mighty wizards: Alice and Bob. They each have a sequence of N distinct positive integers — a for Alice and b for Bob.
For the good of the kingdom, these two sequences must become identical, but initially they are not.
Fortunately, they can use their magical abilities to perform coordinated swaps to make their sequences identical.

Abilities:

Alice's Ability (A[i]):
She can choose any two positions L and R in her sequence and swap the numbers at those positions.

Bob's Ability (B[i]):
After Alice makes her swap between positions L and R, Bob must also swap elements in his sequence.
However, he must choose two positions P and Q such that the distance between them is the same as Alice's swap (|L - R| = |P - Q|), and then swap those two elements.

Goal:
Using a series of such coordinated swaps, determine whether it is possible to make Alice’s and Bob’s sequences identical.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer N — the length of the sequences.
The second line contains N space-separated distinct positive integers — the sequence Alice has.
The third line contains N space-separated distinct positive integers — the sequence Bob has.
