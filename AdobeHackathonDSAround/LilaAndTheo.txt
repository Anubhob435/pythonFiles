Problem Statement

Lila and Theo, two daring adventurers, stumble upon a mysterious array of enchanted gems while exploring ancient ruins. Each gem carries a unique power value, and legends say that collecting them in the right order unlocks unimaginable power. Eager to prove their prowess, they decide to engage in a competitive game.

The Game:

An array A of N gems, each with a unique power value, lies before them. The rules are simple:

Lila and Theo take turns picking a gem from either the left or right end of the array.
Each chosen gem is added to their collection, which must always form a strictly increasing sequence in power values.
Lila makes the first move.
The objective is to be the adventurer who adds the final gem to their collection, making the last move.

Both Lila and Theo play optimally, always choosing the best move to extend the game as long as possible.
